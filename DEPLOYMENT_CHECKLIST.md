# Deployment Checklist - Sport Commerce Registration System

## üîç Pre-Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist before deploying to production or staging environments.

---

## 1. Security Configuration

### JWT Configuration

- [ ] Generate a strong, random JWT secret (minimum 256 bits / 32 characters)
- [ ] Store JWT secret in environment variables (not in code)
- [ ] Review token expiration times (default: 1 hour for access token)
- [ ] Consider implementing refresh token rotation

```bash
# Generate a secure JWT secret
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Password Security

- [ ] BCrypt strength is appropriate (default: 10)
- [ ] Password validation regex is enforced
- [ ] Passwords are never logged

### HTTPS/TLS

- [ ] Enable HTTPS for all API endpoints
- [ ] Install valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Force HTTPS redirect
- [ ] Update CORS configuration if needed

---

## 2. Database Configuration

### MySQL Setup

- [ ] Database created and accessible
- [ ] Strong database password set
- [ ] Database user has appropriate permissions only
- [ ] Database backup strategy in place
- [ ] Connection pooling configured
- [ ] Database indexes created (see database-setup.sql)

### Connection Settings

- [ ] Database credentials stored in environment variables
- [ ] Connection timeout configured
- [ ] Maximum pool size set appropriately
- [ ] SSL/TLS enabled for database connection (production)

```properties
# Production database settings
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=10
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=30000
```

---

## 3. Email Configuration

### SMTP Settings

- [ ] Email credentials stored in environment variables
- [ ] SMTP connection tested
- [ ] Email templates reviewed
- [ ] Sender email address verified
- [ ] SPF/DKIM records configured

### Email Service Recommendations

---

## 4. Application Configuration

### Environment Variables

- [ ] All sensitive data moved to environment variables
- [ ] .env file not committed to version control
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations created

```bash
# Required environment variables
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
DB_NAME=
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=
MAIL_HOST=
MAIL_PORT=
MAIL_USERNAME=
MAIL_PASSWORD=
JWT_SECRET=
```

### application.properties

spring.jpa.show-sql=false
```

---

## 5. Rate Limiting & Caching

### Cache Configuration

- [ ] Rate limit settings reviewed
- [ ] Daily resend limit appropriate
- [ ] Cache expiration times verified

---

## 6. API Security

### Spring Security

    .xssProtection()
    .and()
    .contentSecurityPolicy("default-src 'self'");
```

### Input Validation

- [ ] All inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection protection verified (JPA handles this)

- [ ] File upload validation (if added)

---

## 7. Monitoring & Logging

### Logging Setup

- [ ] Centralized logging configured (ELK, CloudWatch, etc.)
- [ ] Log rotation configured
- [ ] Error tracking service integrated (Sentry, Rollbar)
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs (OTP, passwords, tokens)

### Monitoring

- [ ] Application health check endpoint added
- [ ] Metrics endpoint configured (Spring Actuator)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring setup
- [ ] Database connection monitoring
